my requirement is to write a java script that reads the data send from arduino board to host pc via USB
serial port and push the data to data base. 
Similarly, the same java script will read the stored data in DB which is send by the user (using his mobile/ web app) 
and push it to the serial port, so that the arduino board can read it for further processing
